    "# Plain tdmclient interactive session\n",

    "Communicating with a [Thymio II](https://thymio.org) robot is mostly the same from a Jupyter notebook or from the plain Python repl. You must also connect a Thymio II to your computer and start [Thymio Suite](https://www.thymio.org/program/). The main differences are that you interrupt execution by clicking the stop button (the little square button next to Run, below the menu) instead of typing control-C; and that you can use directly the `await` keyword. And of course, you can add titles, text, links, graphics, etc.\n",

The easiest way to receive and process them is to call asynchronous functions in such a way that their result is waited for.

    "  - The node locking is done in a `with` construct, so that unlocking will be performed automatically at the end even if an error occurs. And `client.lock()` gives us directly the first node: no need to call `wait_for_node`.\n",
    "  - Getting and setting Thymio variables is done via attributes of `node.v` using the same dotted syntax as used in the official documentation of the Thymio.\n",
    "  - Thymio variable values are cached. When you read them, you get the last value which was received from the TDM. At the beginning, we await `node.wait_for_variables` to make sure the variable(s) we're interested has been received. When you set them, you must call `node.flush()` to send all your changes to the Thymio.\n",
    "  - All variables are integers; that's why we use the integer division operator `//` instead of the floating-point division operator `/`.\n",
    "  - No need to be too greedy, it's wise to slow down the loop by calling `client.sleep` with a sensible value. The meaning of _sensible_ depends on the speed of the connection. With the wireless dongle, it can be slow, especially with many robots in the same room."
